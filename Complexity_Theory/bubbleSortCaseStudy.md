# Bubble Sort - Case Study

Repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order

It is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort

Bubble sort has a Worst-Case and Average-Case complexity of **O(N^2)**
