A Software Component is an architectural entity that encapsulates a subset of the system's functionality and/or data

Components typically provide application specific services

Software componenets also restrict access to that subset via an explicitly defined interface

Components can also have their own specifically defined dependencies on its required execution environment



A Software Connector is an architectual entity effecting and regulating interaction among components

Connectors typically provide application independant interaction facilities

In application, connecters might simply be procedure calls or shared data accesses but they could also be very complex



A Software Architecture Configeration is the place where Components and Connectors are all composed in a specific way in a system architecture to acomplish a systems objective

More specifically, Architectural Configeration is an association between components and connectors of a software architecture
