#Sequence Diagram

A Sequence Diagram is an interaction diagram that ephasizes the time ordering of messages

To create a sequence diagram you start by placing all of the participating interactable objects in sequencial order on the x-axis at the top of your diagram, the first object should be able to initialise the others

Next, draw the Object Lifeline by placing dashed vertical lines starting from each object pointing directly down the rest of the graph, for the first object make it a solid line

For the first object draw numbered arrows pointing to the next object's lifeline for each interaction that effects the next object, place a short message above the arrow line that describes the interaction
