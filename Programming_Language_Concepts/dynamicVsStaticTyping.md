#Dynamic Vs Static Typing

Dynamic:

more flexible

usually conceptually simpler

faster compilation

easier runtime code generation/modification

-

###Static:

compile-time detection of errors

no unit tests for type checking

automatic documentation

faster runtime (dynamic checks, optimization)

less memory consumption at runtime

Both can be subtle!
