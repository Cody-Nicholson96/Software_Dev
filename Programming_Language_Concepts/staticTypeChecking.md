#Static Type Checking

- Compiler analyzes code for errors

- Reports (rejects) programs with incorrect usage

- Programmer's annotations or type inference

- Found in C, Java, Scala, Haskell, Rust, Coq, etc.

- Standalone: Facebook's Flow for JavaScript

- Often conservative; well-behaved programs rejected?
