# Variables

A variable is a 'place' in memory that you can store something in, like a box

What we can do with a variable is assign the type of data that we want to put in that 'box' of memory, and we can give our variable a name

Variables are used to store information

-

To use variables we must define the **data type**

Then we need to assign a name to our variable

And then we can optionally assign a value to the variable

-

Example:

```java
int myFirstNumber = 5;
```

The first part of the line, 'int', is the **data type** of our variable - this tells java to make a place in memory to store a variable of type 'int'

We represent this spot in memory with the name 'myFirstNumber', but we could name it anything else

Lastly, we set our int variable to the value of 5

-

We can print out our variable like this:

```java
System.out.println(myFirstNumber);
```

-

Java knows how to do math

```java
int num = 5 + 4 * 3;
System.out.println(num);
```

The above code will print "17" because java knows how to do math, and how to follow order of operations
