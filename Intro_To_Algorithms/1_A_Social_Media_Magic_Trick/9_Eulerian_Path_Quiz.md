# Eulerian Path Quiz

For this problem we have a social network:

```
Tyrone --- Marcie --- Sayo
  |          |          |
Hubert --- Javier --- Christian
```

***

#### We want to know what node we will end on if we start a Eulerian Path starting with the Javier node

A Euclidean Path is a path that uses every edge of a graph exactly once

**The correct answer is Marcie**

***

#### How many Eulerian Paths does the social network have?

**6**
