#Var Vs Val

In Scala you can declare variables using "var" or "val"

You do not need to provide a datatype because Scala is smart enough to figure our the datatype on its own based on your input

A **var** is mutable, meaning you can change the value of that variable after you declare it

A **val** is immutable, meaning you cannot change the value of that variable after you declare it
