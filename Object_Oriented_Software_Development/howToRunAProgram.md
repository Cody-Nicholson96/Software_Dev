#How To Run A Program

1. Compile -- may compile pieces of program separately, creating multiple object files and "libraries" or "archives" ("jar" file)

2. (Static linking and initialization)

3. Load program into memory

4. Dynamic linking and initialization

5. Run

The first two steps are static -- happen at compile time.

The last three steps are dynamic -- happen at runtime.
