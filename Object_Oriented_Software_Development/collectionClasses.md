# Collection Classes

A collection may hold references to many other objects.

Usually the objects are of some uniform type, eg, a list of dogs, a set of colors

java.util provides several collection classes. (See the java tutorial.)

We may implement our own collections. Usually these make use of the java.util classes.

In the following example, IntegerStack delegates most of its responsibilities to List.
