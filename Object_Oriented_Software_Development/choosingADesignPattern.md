Choosing a Design Pattern:

Builder - For immutable, biulds a complex object out of multiple simple objects

Static Factory - For mutable, builds an object using a static factory method

Strategy - Behavior inherited and implementation is encapsulated, you can change the behavior at any time

Command - If message is inherited, gives the user different options every time, encapsulates the messages between objects
