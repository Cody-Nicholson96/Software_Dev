# Property (field) Injection

Property injection is when the dependency is inserted into a property (or field in Java)

Useful for cross-cutting concerns (e.g. Settings, inputs/outputs)

Allows any object anywhere to specify an object to satisfy the dependency

Can set a default value in the constructor (optional)
