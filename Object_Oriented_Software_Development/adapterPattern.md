#Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern is used to make some other code that you canâ€™t modify work with your application as you need it to

You wrap what you need into your own classes/interfaces (as needed), and your application uses the classes/interfaces you created

Your wrapper class passes along functionality to the subject as needed (similar to decorator and proxy pattern)
