# Software Developer Guest Speaker

A software developer came into class to talk to us about real world challanges in the field

## Common Software Challenges

### Choosing the right abstraction

Make sure your architecture is appropriate for the expected data throughout

Never let your application have explicit dependencies on external services

Know your limitations on external services, and ensure your code will honor them

A software engineer can summarize a complex problem in simple terms without losing sight of the complexity

***

### Applying Design Patterns Appropriately

Interfaces are timeless; implementations are fleeting

Build what you need to meet today's requirements: don't dream up elaborate constructs you'll only end up tearing it down

Beware of external services, know their limits before building software around them

Make the right decision for today, but allow for the possibility that it may change tomorrow
