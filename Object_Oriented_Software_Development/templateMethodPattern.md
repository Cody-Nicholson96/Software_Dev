#Template Method Pattern

We just implemented the template method pattern

An abstract class is created with a concrete method and an abstract method. The concrete method calls the abstract method. The (concrete) subclasses of the abstract class implement that abstract method

Similar purpose as strategy, but abstract classes offer more functionality than interfaces
