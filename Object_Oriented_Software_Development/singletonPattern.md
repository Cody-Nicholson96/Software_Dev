# Singleton Pattern

This is called the Singleton pattern

Singleton is when you have a single instance of an object and other instances can’t be initialized

The single instance can be accessed statically

-

Make sure you don’t have any cloning or copying functions

You don’t want to accidentally allow the creation of a new instance
