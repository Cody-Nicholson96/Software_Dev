# Association


![alt tag](https://github.com/Cody-Nicholson96/Software_Development/blob/master/Object_Oriented_Software_Development/pics/association.jpg)

The diagram describes the relationship of objects without reference to implementation.

The diagram uses associations which may be either dependencies or references.

Associations are more abstract (less specific, less concrete) than dependencies and references.

The diagram also show the use of roles and names in associations.

An association without an arrowhead may be bidirectional.
