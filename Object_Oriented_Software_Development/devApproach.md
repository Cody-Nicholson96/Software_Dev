# The Development Approach is an "extreme" style

-Develop incrementally
    - Start small
    - Make sure you have beautiful code that works before you add functionality

-Think before you code
    - Design in small pieces -- don't do everything at once.
    - Accept that the design will change.


-Write good tests
    - Don't test you program by running it. Use automatic tests!
    - If the tests pass, you should be pretty sure you coded correctly

-Write good code
    - First, write the simplest code possible.
    - Get it to work (pass the tests).
    - Last, improve the code by refactoring: improve structure without changing functionality.


-Iterate
    - Once you get something beautiful that works, begin to design the next piece of functionality
