###Uml sequence diagrams
-

Depict a sequence of messages being passed around for some method as well as depict the activity of objects

###UML Class Diagrams: Object Class
-

An object class looks like this:

![alt tag](https://github.com/Cody-Nicholson96/Software_Development/blob/master/Object_Oriented_Software_Development/pics/objectClass.jpg)

The class name is not underlined

Non-static methods are not underlined

Fields are listed first, methods second

> - is private
> + is public

A static class describes the class itself.
An object class describes the instances of the class

***

###UML Class Diagrams: Static Class
-

A static class looks like this:

![alt tag](https://github.com/Cody-Nicholson96/Software_Development/blob/master/Object_Oriented_Software_Development/pics/staticClass.jpg)

The class name is not underlined

Static methods are underlined

> <<static>> is a stereotype

Method return type follows colon

May contain static fields, which are also underlined (none shown here)
