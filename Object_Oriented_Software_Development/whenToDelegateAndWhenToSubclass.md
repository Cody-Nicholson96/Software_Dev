#When to delegate and when to subclass

Always prefer delegation! Decisions can be delayed to runtime instead of compile-time. This allows more flexibility.

Think about the Strategy pattern and the flexibility it offers.

Think about the Decorator pattern: You are adding specific functionality to existing functionality but you are delegating to the existing functionality rather than subclassing it.
