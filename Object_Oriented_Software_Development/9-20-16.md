StringBuilder objects are mutable, String objects are immutable

___

###How to unit test
-

- Check for edge cases: Null, empty lists, indexes out of range, etc
- Look at requirements to easily add test condtions
- Make sure to test for when exceptions should be thrown
- Make sure other unit tests do not affect the outcome of this unit test

___

###SOLID Principles  (Single Responsibility
-

- By clean code book Martin
- Single responsiblity principle
- open-close principle
- Liskov Substitution principle
- Interface Segregation
- Dependancy Inversion principles

___

###Single Responsiblity Principle
-

- A class should have only one reason to change
- Every time you need to open up a file, you risk breaking something
- Allowing access to more (fields/methods) than is necessary is also risky
- More responsibilities -> More dependencies
- Dependencies change -> rebuilds/retests/redeploys must occur
- More dependencies -> more complexity -> more opportunity to break

___

###Packages/Namespace are a way of organizing related packages
___

###Classpath
-

- The classpath tells Java from where to load classes from user-created packages
- If no classpath specified, Java looks in current folder
- In other words, it can only load files from the default package
- The classpath can contain multiple folders

___

###Scope
-

- Scope determines the visibility of fields, methods, and classes
- Scope can be determined in two ways: keywords (e.g. public, private) and code blocks (e.g. {})
- Members of outer scopes are visible to members of inner scopes, but not the other way around

___

###Four types of visibility in Java:
-

- Public is visible to: Class, Package, Subclass, World
- Protected is visible to: Class, Package, Subclass
- Package-private (no modifier) is visible to: Class, Package
- Private (This is private class, not instance variable) is visible to: Class, Subclass?

___

###Encapsulation
-

- Keep implementation details hidden
- “Black box programming”
- Large organizations function because not everyone needs to know every detail all the time -- they break down when too many people need to know too much.

-

- Math.random() provides a pseudo-random number without the caller needing to know how
- Encapsulating is about abstracting the functionality from the caller
- In Java, when you send information across a network, you don’t create individual packets

___

###Abstraction
-

- OO Design is about defining good abstractions
- Abstractions distribute responsibilities
- Code provider vs code consumer/client

___

###Interface
-

- An interface (the concept, not the Java construct interface) is what client programmers interact with:
- The interface of a package is the names of its public classes and interfaces.
- The interface of a class (or interface) is the name and type of its public members.
- The interface of a method is its type (arguments and return).

-

####What makes a good interface?
-

- Good interfaces have high cohesion
- Cohesion - should be describable in one short sentence
- Cohesion = SRP

___

###Encapsulation: Principle of Least Knowledge
-

- Hide as much as possible
- Don't make commitments you can't keep
- The more you hide, the less chance you have for tight coupling
- Think back to SRP issue in Homework 1 – Record and InventorySet are “tightly” coupled. Changes to Record can require changes to InventorySet
- Only acceptable time where changing the functionality of one class changes others is when a public interface is changed

___

###Types
-

- Runtime type ()
- Compile time type (Left side, declared type)

___

###Subtypes
-

- A subtype is a type that extends another type
- Even though it’s “extending”, a subtype could have less functionality than the parent (private methods)
- Objects can be subtypes of more than one type (e.g. Integer is a subtype of both Object and Comparable)
- Subtyping is Transitive (if A : B and B : C, then A : C)

-

When assigning an object to a reference, the left side will always be less specific or as specific as the right side

```java
/*Valid:*/ Integer i = new Integer(2);
/*Valid:*/ Object o = i;
/*Invalid:*/ i = o;
```

-

When calling a method, you can pass in the requested type as an argument or a more specific type (contravariance). The return type will be as specific or less specific than the type of the objects being returned (covariance)

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
{
    Integer i = new Integer(2);
    Execption ex = getException(i);
    throw ex;
}

public static Exception getException(Object o)
{
    if(o.hashCode() > 5)
        return new IOException();
    else
        return new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
}
```

___

###Interfaces
-

Interfaces provide no implementation, they only provide a contract to consumers guaranteeing an implementing object has certain methods (and/or properties in C#), and what those method signatures look like

-

Default Interface

If a class implements multiple interfaces, and multiple have a default implementation for the same method, the implementing class must specify its own implementation

```java
interface Colored {
  Color getColor();
}
interface Point {
  double getX();
  double getY();
}
final class CartesianPoint implements Colored, Point {
  /* ... */
}
final class PolarPoint implements Colored, Point {
  /* ... */
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CartesianPoint p1 = new CartesianPoint(0,0,Color.RED);
        PolarPoint r1 = new PolarPoint(0,0,Color.RED);
        printColor(p1);
        printColor(p2);
    }

    public void printColor(CartesianPoint point){
        System.out.println(point.getColor());
    }

    public void printColor(PolarPoint point){
        System.out.println(point.getColor());
    }
}
```

___

###Late Binding
-

The actual method being called is determined at Runtime, based on the object’s actual type (not the type of the reference)

___

###Casting
-

- Casting: changing the declared type of an object (does not change the actual object in memory itself)
- Downcasting: casting from supertype to subtype
- Upcasting: casting from subtype to supertype

-

####Casting - Compile-time and Run-time checks

In Java, the compiler will check to see if a given cast is potentially valid
It will check if the type you’re trying to cast to is a supertype or subtype of the type you’re trying to cast from
Run-time will also perform the same check – why?

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    String str = "Hello World";
    int i = (int)str;
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

___

###Type Coercion
-

- Coercion: similar in concept (and syntax) to Casting
- Changes the actual type of the object, as opposed to casting which changes just the pointer’s declared type and not the object’s actual type

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    float f = 2.5f;
    int i = (int)f;
    f = i;
    System.out.println(f);
  }
}
```

___

###Design Patterns
-

- Elements of software design that are reusable
- Provide a common vocabulary for software designers
- Way of laying out your code/classes that make it easier to maintain/use
- Patterns because there is no single use of that design – it’s an abstraction
- Not language specific

___

###Gang of four design principles
-

-Program to an interface, not an implementation
-Favor object composition (delegation) over class inheritance
-Consider what should be variable in your design: encapsulate the concepts that vary

___

###Factory
-

Factory is an object that makes other objects

-

####Static factory classes

- What if I want to hide class names from clients?
- This could be because class names are still changing or even just because clients don’t need to know (principle of least knowledge)
- Use a static factory

-

####Steps:

- Make interface public
- Make classes package-private
- Provide a public static* class (the factory) which will do the actual creation of the objects

-

- Other packages use the static factory methods, not the constructors of the objects
- Factory methods can take in parameters to pass along to the object’s constructors or to initialize the object

___

###Strategy Pattern
-

- Strategy object provides a consumer with information about what it needs to do
- Producer also wants to choose what to run and when
- Encapsulates behavior

___

###Command pattern
-

Very similar to Strategy pattern, but the producer doesn’t care what it does
