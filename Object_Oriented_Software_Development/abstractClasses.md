# Abstract Classes

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and provides some default behaviors that child classes may or may not override.

An abstract class can force a child class to implement a function by marking it abstract.

In Java, a subclass can override any function of the parent. In C#, an abstract class (or any class) can suggest a subclass might want to override behavior by marking it virtual
