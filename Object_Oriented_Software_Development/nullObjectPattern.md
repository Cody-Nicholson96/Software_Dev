#Null Object Pattern

The Null Object is an object that provides default behavior (typically nothing) that can be used in place of null in code

Since the Null Object isn’t null, it won’t throw NullReferenceExceptions

Since it provides default behavior, we don’t need to worry about checking for null before trying to use it
