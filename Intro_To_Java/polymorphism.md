Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is the ability for a method defined in an interface to be used in any class that implements that interface

It gives us extensible software system

We can start with something simple and extend the functionality by adding mroe and more subclasses

Polymorphism is one of the two cornerstones of OO programming



The second is Encapsulation which allows us to separate the interface of a class from its implementation so our implementations are able to evolve without having to change the rest of the system
