#Error and Algorithm Notes

###Errors:

compile-time error (or syntax error)

This is an error that happens when the ide trys to compile your code, like forgetting a semicolon or trying to print a string without quotations

-

run-time error (or logic error)

The program can run fine but the logic is wrong, like mispelling a word in a string or dividing by zero

***

###Algorithms are umabiguous, executable, and terminating

Pseudocode has:

Computation, x = y + z;

Decision, if x1 < x2 (print("Hi"));

Repetition, while x < 30 (x+1);
