# Input Files

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException
{
    File inputFile = new File("input.txt");
    Scanner in = new Scanner(inputFile);
}
```

This method will take in a file called input.txt

You could also change that to take a "String input" that you could pass through as an argument
