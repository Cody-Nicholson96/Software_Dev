#TextPad

TextPad has been around for many years and is sometimes known as The Text Editor for Windows. TextPad is essentially a plain text editor that runs on Windows. It supports different languages through add-ons known as clip libraries, dictionaries, macros, and syntax definitions. When using TextPad to write C# code, you'll be most interested in the Syntax Definitions that provide the keyword color highlighting.

Choosing a tool like TextPad means that you have a lightweight editor for your C# code files but it also means that you don't get the full benefits of an IDE and as such you will be responsible for:

- Managing multiple files for your project

- Compiling the code using the command-line compiler tools from Microsoft

- Manual debugging of the code through code review

- Manual deployment of the application
