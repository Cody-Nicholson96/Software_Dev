#Visual Studio

Visual Studio is the preferred tool for most programmers who are writing code in C#.  Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that offers many features designed to make your coding chores much easier.  With Visual Studio you will enjoy color syntax and code formatting which makes it easier to see keywords and code structure.  Intellisense and code completion save you time in wirting code and looking up method signatures.

Visual Studio includes integrated debugging facilities to help you troubleshoot your code when things go wrong.

Visual Studio 2013 and later offers Peek Definition that allows you to view and edit code in other files in the project, without losing your place in the current code listing.

You can manage your entire solution, which may include multiple project files, all from within Visual Studio.  Deployment of your applications is also easy using Visual Studio, whether you are deploying to a mobile device, a Web server, or the cloud.
