#NotePad

Of course Microsoft Windows has the venerable Notepad app included with every copy.  You can write your code in Notepad and then use the command-line compiler csc.exe to compile your code.

Take note that you will not realize any benefits such as code completion, intellisense, syntax highlighting, or complete project solution and file management.   And you will need to learn the available options and switches for the command line compiler.
