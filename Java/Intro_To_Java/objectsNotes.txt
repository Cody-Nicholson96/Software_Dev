Object:
-Building block of program
-Component with some desired functionality
-You ask objects to do work
-An instance of a class

Calling a method of an objects class:
object.methodName(arguments);

Creating a new object of class/type Picture:
Picture rocket = new Picture("rocket.png");



Class:
-Objects with common behavior
-Classes have methods that allow you to execute functions on the objects, which are instances of the class

Ex:
String is a type, String name = "Joe";, but it is also a class
In the String class, for example, there is a method .length()
name.length() = 3 in this case



Variables:
-Use a variable to store a value that you need later
-Every variable has a name

Ex:
Type variableName
Picture rocket;
String name;
int x;
boolean isItBlue;

There is a class for every variable type that has its own built in methods, like all String's have the method .length()



Comments:

Use "//"" to create a comment in your code to describe what it does

Ex:

x = 3;
// The reason I started x at 3 was because I like the number 3



To construct objects:

Rectangle box = new Rectangle(x,y,z,a);

-Check the object type's documentation to see the different ways you can create the object
