Math Functions

Method  Return Value
Math.sqrt (n)   Square root of n ( if n is > or = to 0)
Math.pow(a,b)   a^b( if a = 0, b must be >0)
Math.sin(n) Sine of n where n is in radians
Math.cos(n) Cosine of n where n is in radians
Math.tan(n) Tangent of n where n is in radians
Math.round(n)   closest integer to n as a long
Math.ceil(n)    smallest integer > or = to n as a double
Math.floor(n)   largest integer < or = to n as a double
Math.toRadians(n)   Converts n degrees to radians
Math.toDegrees(n)   Converts n radians to degrees
Math.abs(n) Absolute value of n |n|
Math.max(a,b)   The larger of a and b
Math.min(a,b)   The smaller of a and b
Math.exp(n) e^n
Math.log(n) natural log of n
Math.log10(n)   Base 10 log of n



Integer Arithmetic

Expression  Value (when n =2497)    Description
n/10    249 Notice that the answer is an integer with no decimal part.
n % 10  7   Always the last digit of n
n /100  24  Again, decimal part is discarded. Removes the last 2 digits.
n % 100 97  The last two digits.
n % 2   1   If n % 2 is 0 the number is even. Otherwise it is odd.




Number Literals Description Examples
