# Functions For OOP

```c++
// Functions allow you to reuse and better organize your code

cout << addNumbers(1) << endl;

// You can't access values created in functions (Out of Scope)
// cout << combinedValue << endl;

cout << addNumbers(1, 5, 6) << endl;

cout << "The factorial of 3 is " << getFactorial(3) << endl;
```
