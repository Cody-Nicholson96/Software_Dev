# For Loop

```c++
// Continues to execute code as long as a condition is true

for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
	cout << i << endl;
}

// You can also cycle through an array by nesting for loops
for(int j = 0; j < 5; j++){

	for(int k = 0; k < 5; k++){
		cout << myName[j][k];
	}
 
	cout << endl;
}
```
