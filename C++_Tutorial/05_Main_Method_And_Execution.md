# Main & Execution

```c++
// This is where execution begins. Attributes can be sent to main
int main() {
 
	// cout outputs text and a carriage return with endl
	// Statements must end with a semicolon
	// Strings must be surrounded by "
	// << sends the text via standard output to the screen
	cout << "Hello Internet" << endl;
}
```
